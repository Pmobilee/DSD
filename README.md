# DSD - Direct Self-Distillation

## About

This repository contains a novel approach to distillation of Diffusion Models, as detailed in the (currently unpublished) thesis/paper titled "A Self-help guide for Diffusion Models". This method tries to improve upon previous distillation approaches by distilling a model into itself, without the need for any separately initialised teacher model.
